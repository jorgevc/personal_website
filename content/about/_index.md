My work focuses on biomathematics. In particular I study the dynamics of infectious diseasesas Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya. I mainly look to propose prevention and control strategiesin situations where spatial factors and mobility play an important role. I am also interested in ecology and systems biology. I study the factors that allow the coexistence of species andstructured populations and the dynamics of gene regulatory networks. In order to achieve this, I usemathematical models in combination with computational simulations. I look to make my researchtruly multidisciplinary by collaborating with biologist, entomologist, physicist and mathematicians.
